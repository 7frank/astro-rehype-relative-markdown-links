# Contribution Guidelines

Hello!! If you've made it this far you're seriously considering writing some code! Thanks for that, I really appreciate it!

There's very few guidelines for contributing to this project. I'm not a fan of strict rules, so I'll keep it simple.

- Be nice!
- Write tests
- Format your code (run `yarn prettier` or set up formatting in your IDE of choice)

That's it! Told you it was simple!
